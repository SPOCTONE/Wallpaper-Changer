# Wallpaper-Changer

A script written in Python using the windll API of the ctypes library which uses the randint() method of the random module to select an image from a set of already provided images in a specified folder(here, the wallpapers folder) in the root directory to set as the Desktop wallpaper at a time of your choice(here, set at 2200 hrs) every day using the schedule module.
